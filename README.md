## üìä What You'll See in Reports

![AWS Cost Monitor Email Report Example](public/images/example.png)

Each email report includes four key metrics displayed prominently:

1. **Today (Full Day)** - Today's costs from midnight to midnight (may be incomplete)
2. **Yesterday (Full Day)** - Complete 24-hour costs from the previous day
3. **Month to Date** - Running total from the 1st to now
4. **Previous Month** - Last month's complete total for comparison

**Important Note about "Today" costs**: Due to AWS Cost Explorer API limitations and cost considerations, we fetch full day data rather than hourly breakdowns. This means "Today" shows the entire day's costs, which may be incomplete if AWS hasn't reported all costs yet (can take up to 24 hours).

## üåç Timezone Configuration

The system supports **all global timezones** with automatic Daylight Saving Time handling:

### Popular Timezone Examples

```bash
# United States
USER_TIMEZONE=US/Eastern      # New York, Miami, Atlanta
USER_TIMEZONE=US/Central      # Chicago, Dallas, Houston (default)
USER_TIMEZONE=US/Mountain     # Denver, Phoenix
USER_TIMEZONE=US/Pacific      # Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco

### DST Handling

The system **automatically handles DST transitions**:

- When clocks "spring forward", your 7 AM report stays at 7 AM
- When clocks "fall back", your 7 AM report stays at 7 AM
- No manual adjustments needed - ever!

## üí∞ Monthly Running Cost: ~$1.20

**Important**: This tool costs approximately **$1.20/month** to run, primarily from AWS Cost Explorer API charges:

- **Cost Explorer API**: $1.20/month ($0.01 per API call √ó 120 calls)
- **Other AWS services**: ~$0.10/month (Lambda, SES, CloudWatch Logs)
- **Total**: ~$1.30/month

*Note: There is NO free tier for the Cost Explorer API. Each API call costs $0.01 from the first request.*

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- SAM CLI installed (`brew install aws-sam-cli`)
- AWS Organizations set up (or single account)
- Access to deploy Lambda functions and create IAM roles
- Python 3.12 runtime support

### 1. Configuration Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository (if using as template)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-cost-monitor.git
cd aws-cost-monitor

# Copy the example configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your settings
nano .env  # or vim, code, etc.
```

Example `.env` configuration:

```bash
# Required: Email Configuration
EMAIL_TO=john.doe@company.com,jane.smith@company.com
EMAIL_FROM=aws-costs@company.com

# Required: Set your local timezone
USER_TIMEZONE=US/Eastern  # Change to your timezone!

# Optional: AWS Configuration
AWS_PROFILE=production    # If using named profiles
AWS_REGION=us-east-1     # Defaults to us-east-1

# Optional: Alert Thresholds
ANOMALY_THRESHOLD_PERCENT=50  # 50% increase triggers alert
ANOMALY_THRESHOLD_DOLLARS=50  # AND $50 increase
AI_SERVICE_MULTIPLIER=0.5     # AI services: 25% and $25
```

### 2. Deploy in 2 Minutes

```bash
# Quick deployment using .env file
./deploy.sh

# With specific AWS profile
./deploy.sh --profile production

# Override configuration via command line
./deploy.sh --email-to alerts@company.com --timezone US/Pacific

# See all options
./deploy.sh --help
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Verify email addresses in SES before the Lambda can send emails:

1. Go to [SES Verified Identities](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home#/verified-identities)
2. Click "Create identity" ‚Üí Choose "Email address"
3. Add both EMAIL_TO and EMAIL_FROM addresses
4. Check email and click verification links
5. For production, consider moving out of SES sandbox

### 4. Test Your Setup

```bash
# Manually trigger the Lambda
aws lambda invoke --function-name aws-cost-monitor /tmp/test.json
cat /tmp/test.json

# Check logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/aws-cost-monitor --follow

# With profile
aws --profile production lambda invoke --function-name aws-cost-monitor /tmp/test.json
```

## üìß Email Report Structure

### Report Header

Shows the current date and time in your configured timezone:

```
AWS Cost Report
December 15, 2024 at 1:00 PM EST
```

### Cost Summary Section

Four metric boxes displaying:

- **Today (X.X hours)**: $XXX.XX
- **Yesterday (Full Day)**: $XXX.XX
- **Month to Date**: $X,XXX.XX
- **November (Full Month)**: $X,XXX.XX

### Anomaly Alerts

When detected, shows:

- üö® Critical alerts for AI service spikes over $100
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings for services exceeding thresholds
- Comparison between today's prorated costs vs yesterday

### Detailed Breakdown

- Account-by-account costs for today
- Service-level details within each account
- AI services highlighted in yellow
- Costs under $0.01 are filtered out

## üéØ Anomaly Detection Logic

The system uses intelligent anomaly detection:

1. **Daily Comparison**: Compares today's full day costs vs yesterday's full day
2. **Dual Thresholds**: Both percentage AND dollar thresholds must be exceeded
3. **AI Service Sensitivity**: AI services use 0.5x multiplier (more sensitive)

Example scenarios:

- Normal service: Needs >50% AND >$50 increase to alert
- AI service: Needs >25% AND >$25 increase to alert
- Critical: Any AI service increase >$100 triggers immediate alert

**Note**: Since we compare full days, anomalies are detected based on the total daily spend. Today's data may be incomplete, so some anomalies might be due to delayed cost reporting.

### Customizing Schedule Times

The default schedule (7 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM, 11 PM) is defined in `template.yaml`. To change:

1. Note your timezone's UTC offset
2. Calculate the UTC hours for your desired local times
3. Update the cron expression:

```yaml
# Current: 7 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM, 11 PM Central Time
Schedule: cron(0 13,19,0,5 * * ? *)

# Example: 9 AM and 5 PM Eastern Time (UTC-5)
# 9 AM EST = 2 PM UTC, 5 PM EST = 10 PM UTC
Schedule: cron(0 14,22 * * ? *)

# Example: Every 6 hours starting at midnight local time
# Calculate midnight in UTC for your timezone
Schedule: rate(6 hours)
```

2. Check timezone spelling (case-sensitive)
3. Remember: times shown are YOUR local time, not UTC

### Missing Cost Data

- Cost Explorer can have up to 24-hour delay
- Some services report costs delayed
- Ensure Lambda has proper permissions
- Check AWS Organizations access

### View Logs

```bash
# Recent executions
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/aws-cost-monitor

# Live monitoring
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/aws-cost-monitor --follow

# Search for errors
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/aws-cost-monitor \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR"
```

## üí∞ Detailed Cost Breakdown

As mentioned at the top, this tool costs approximately **$1.20/month** to run:

### Cost Explorer API (90% of total cost)
- **No free tier** - $0.01 per API request from the first call
- 1 API call per Lambda execution (fetches all time periods in one request)
- 4 executions daily √ó 30 days = 120 API calls/month
- 120 √ó $0.01 = **$1.20/month**

### Other AWS Services
- **Lambda**: ~$0.03/month (well within free tier)
- **SES**: ~$0.02/month (under free tier for most users)
- **CloudWatch Logs**: ~$0.05/month (minimal logging)
- **EventBridge**: FREE (no charges for scheduled rules)

### Cost Optimization
We use DAILY granularity for all queries to keep costs at ~$1.20/month. Using HOURLY granularity would increase costs to $30+ per month due to the increased number of API calls required.
